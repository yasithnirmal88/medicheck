"""Phase 11 — AI care-coordination API (CHW operational suggestions).

Endpoints:
- POST /api/v1/ai-care-coordination/suggestions : generate operational
  suggestions for the caller's CHW queue (operational factors only).
- GET  /api/v1/ai-care-coordination/suggestions : list the caller's persisted
  suggestions (own only — IDOR enforced).

All suggestions are administrative assistance ONLY — they never determine
clinical priority, severity, or urgency. AI never self-publishes; review is a
separate human-driven workflow (see ai_equity_intelligence router).
